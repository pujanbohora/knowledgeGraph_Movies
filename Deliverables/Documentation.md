## Use Case Scenario
### Narrative
The rise of streaming platforms and the evolving entertainment industry have created a need for more advanced analytical tools to understand movie performance, audience preferences, and industry trends. A knowledge graph can serve as a powerful tool to explore these dynamics by connecting data points such as actors, directors, budgets, gross earnings, and audience ratings across various datasets. For instance, understanding which actors consistently work with specific directors and how those collaborations impact movie ratings can offer insights for both content creators and marketers. Such relationships are valuable when determining the best talent combinations for future projects.

Additionally, analyzing the correlation between a movie's budget and its gross earnings over different decades provides vital financial insights for studios and producers. This allows them to identify trends in financial performance and adjust budget allocations to maximize profitability. The ability to identify the highest-grossing production companies also supports studios in benchmarking against competitors and assessing which production strategies are most successful.

Countries producing the highest-grossing movies can offer insights into global content trends, highlighting which regions are gaining influence in the global entertainment market. Moreover, understanding the performance of high-budget movies in terms of ratings can guide decision makers in detremining how much investment is worth putting into a project and what returns to expect based on audience response.

Incorporating inflation into these analyses adds a critical economic dimension. Inflation affects various aspects of the movie industry, from production budgets to consumer behavior. Analyzing how inflation impacts production costs over time, particularly in countries with fluctuating economic conditions, provides insights into how studios adapt their strategies during periods of financial uncertainity. Furthermore, understanding whether high inflation correlates with lower gross earnings or changes in audience satisfaction (as reflected in ratings) allows stakeholders to better navigate the dual pressures of creative and financial decision-making. By integrating inflation data into the knowledge graph, studios can assess not only past economic impacts but also forecast future trends for more resilient planning.
